descriptions: '[Indrik Spider](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0119) is a Russia-based
  cybercriminal group that has been active since at least 2014. [Indrik Spider](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0119)
  initially started with the [Dridex](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0384) banking
  Trojan, and then by 2017 they began running ransomware operations using [BitPaymer](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0570),
  [WastedLocker](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0612), and Hades ransomware. Following
  U.S. sanctions and an indictment in 2019, [Indrik Spider](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0119)
  changed their tactics and diversified their toolset.(Citation: Crowdstrike Indrik
