descriptions: '[Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) is a North Korean
  state-sponsored cyber threat group that has been attributed to the Reconnaissance
  General Bureau.(Citation: US-CERT HIDDEN COBRA June 2017)(Citation: Treasury North
  Korean Cyber Groups September 2019) The group has been active since at least 2009
  and was reportedly responsible for the November 2014 destructive wiper attack against
  Sony Pictures Entertainment as part of a campaign named Operation Blockbuster by
  Novetta. Malware used by [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032)
  correlates to other reported campaigns, including Operation Flame, Operation 1Mission,
  Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, and Ten Days of Rain.(Citation: Novetta Blockbuster)


  North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security
  researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name
  [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) instead of tracking clusters
  or subgroups, such as [Andariel](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0138), [APT37](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067),
  [APT38](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082), and [Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094).   '
