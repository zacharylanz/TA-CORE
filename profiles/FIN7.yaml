descriptions: '[FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046) is a financially-motivated
  threat group that has been active since 2013. [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046)
  has primarily targeted the retail, restaurant, hospitality, software, consulting,
  financial services, medical equipment, cloud services, media, food and beverage,
  transportation, and utilities industries in the U.S. A portion of [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046)
  was run out of a front company called Combi Security and often used point-of-sale
  malware for targeting efforts. Since 2020, [FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046)
  shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of [REvil](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0496)
  ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside. FIN7 may be linked
  to the [Carbanak](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0008) Group, but there appears
  to be several groups using [Carbanak](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0030) malware
  and are therefore tracked separately.(Citation: FireEye FIN7 March 2017)(Citation:
