  has primarily focused its operations--which have included destructive attacks--against
  South Korean government agencies, military organizations, and a variety of domestic

  and cryptocurrency exchanges. [Andariel](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0138)''s

  [Andariel](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0138) is considered a sub-set of [Lazarus
  Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032), and has been attributed to North
  Korea''s Reconnaissance General Bureau.(Citation: Treasury North Korean Cyber Groups
  September 2019)


  North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security
  researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name
  [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) instead of tracking clusters
  or subgroups.'
