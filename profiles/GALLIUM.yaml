  group that has been active since at least 2012, primarily targeting telecommunications
  companies, financial institutions, and government entities in Afghanistan, Australia,
  Belgium, Cambodia, Malaysia, Mozambique, the Philippines, Russia, and Vietnam. This
  group is particularly known for launching Operation Soft Cell, a long-term campaign
  targeting telecommunications providers.(Citation: Cybereason Soft Cell June 2019)
  Security researchers have identified [GALLIUM](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0093)
  as a likely Chinese state-sponsored group, based in part on tools used and TTPs
  commonly associated with Chinese threat actors.(Citation: Cybereason Soft Cell June
