descriptions: '[HEXANE](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1001) is a cyber espionage
  threat group that has targeted oil & gas, telecommunications, aviation, and internet
  service provider organizations since at least 2017. Targeted companies have been
  located in the Middle East and Africa, including Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco,
  and Tunisia. [HEXANE](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1001)''s TTPs appear similar
  to [APT33](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0064) and [OilRig](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049)
  but due to differences in victims and tools it is tracked as a separate entity.(Citation:
