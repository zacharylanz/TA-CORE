descriptions: '[Gamaredon Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0047) is a suspected
  Russian cyber espionage threat group that has targeted military, NGO, judiciary,
  law enforcement, and non-profit organizations in Ukraine since at least 2013. The
  name [Gamaredon Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0047) comes from a misspelling
  of the word "Armageddon", which was detected in the adversary''s early campaigns.(Citation:
