descriptions: '[Cinnamon Tempest](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1021) is a China-based
  threat group that has been active since at least 2021 deploying multiple strains
  of ransomware based on the leaked [Babuk](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0638)
  source code. [Cinnamon Tempest](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1021) does not
  operate their ransomware on an affiliate model or purchase access but appears to
  act independently in all stages of the attack lifecycle. Based on victimology, the
  short lifespan of each ransomware variant, and use of malware attributed to government-sponsored
  threat groups, [Cinnamon Tempest](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1021) may be
  motivated by intellectual property theft or cyberespionage rather than financial
  gain.(Citation: Microsoft Ransomware as a Service)(Citation: Microsoft Threat Actor
