descriptions: '[Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094) is a North Korea-based
  cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2012. The group initially
  focused on targeting South Korean government entities, think tanks, and individuals
  identified as experts in various fields, and expanded its operations to include
  the United States, Russia, Europe, and the UN. [Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094)
  has focused its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national
  security issues related to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions.(Citation:

  Kimsuky)


  [Kimsuky](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094) was assessed to be responsible
  for the 2014 Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. compromise; other notable campaigns
  include Operation STOLEN PENCIL (2018), Operation Kabar Cobra (2019), and Operation
  Smoke Screen (2019).(Citation: Netscout Stolen Pencil Dec 2018)(Citation: EST Kimsuky

  North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security
  researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name
  [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) instead of tracking clusters
  or subgroups.'
