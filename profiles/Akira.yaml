  and ransomware deployment entity active since at least March 2023.(Citation: Arctic
  Wolf Akira 2023) [Akira](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1024) uses compromised
  credentials to access single-factor external access mechanisms such as VPNs for
  initial access, then various publicly-available tools and techniques for lateral
  movement.(Citation: Arctic Wolf Akira 2023)(Citation: Secureworks GOLD SAHARA) [Akira](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1024)
  operations are associated with "double extortion" ransomware activity, where data
  is exfiltrated from victim environments prior to encryption, with threats to publish
  files if a ransom is not paid. Technical analysis of [Akira](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1129)
  ransomware indicates multiple overlaps with and similarities to [Conti](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0575)
